[{"categories":["Consulting"],"content":"Introduction If you‚Äôve ever tried to give a PowerPoint presentation and switch to your desktop to do a demo, you may have noticed that PowerPoint tends to fight with you to stay in slide show mode. Slide show mode shows your presentation in full screen, but it hides your cursor and captures your keyboard and mouse. If you want to get out of it to do your demo, you have to hit Esc, and Alt-Tab to your demo. Then you have to go back to your presentation, restart the slide show (and often restart at the first slide by mistake). Ugh! You usually end up fighting with Alt-Tab (and potentially reveal to your audience what other applications you‚Äôve got running and/or show your private chats to the world ‚Äì like I‚Äôve done), or end up showing your presentation in PowerPoint without using the slide show (I‚Äôm looking at you, Microsoft employees!) In today‚Äôs post, I‚Äôll explain how you can use the slide show mode and make it easy to switch back and forth between your demo and your presentation. As a bonus, I‚Äôll show you how you can also keep Teams open and monitor the chat window as you present.

When you present to your audience, you‚Äôre competing for their attention and trying to get them to focus on what you‚Äôre showing. They‚Äôre already fighting to stay awake and will probably look at everything on your slides. If you‚Äôre just showing your slides in PowerPoint without the slide show mode, you‚Äôre making harder on your audience to focus and stay engaged. They see all the slides in your deck (‚ÄúOh my god, he‚Äôs got 37 slides! We‚Äôll never get out of here!\"), all the ribbons and buttons (‚ÄúOoh, I wander what the Design Ideas button does?!\"), and you make the content on your slides smaller. \rShowing PowerPoint without slide show ModeJust so we're clear: this is NOT cool! \"\rJust so we're clear: this is NOT cool!\r (Just so we‚Äôre clear: this is not cool!) Don‚Äôt you want to be respectful to your audience and save them from boredom? They certainly want you to! To launch your PowerPoint presentation in slide show mode, you just need to hit F5 from anywhere in your presentation. It‚Äôll start your slides full-screen (unless you use a custom slide show, but that‚Äôs another story). If you want to start from the current slide you‚Äôre editing, you can simply hit Shift-F5. To get out of the slide show mode, hit Esc. So far, this is probably obvious to you (except, maybe, if you‚Äôre a Microsoft employee, who apparently forget about the F5 key as soon as they join Microsoft üòä). The hard part comes next: how to you easily switch between your slide show mode to your demo (without getting out of your slide show)?

I have one for each of my clients, sometimes two (one is a regular user, one is an admin user), plus one for each of my developer tenants, my MVP tenant, and one for when I collaborate with the nicest, most hard-working MVP that I know.

If you don‚Äôt, please follow my instructions and come back when you‚Äôre done. I‚Äôll be right here. I recently moved to a new computer and I haven‚Äôt migrated all my accounts yet, but I‚Äôll the profiles that I already have set up as an example. \rMultiple Profiles in EdgeI have only a few profiles on this PC \"\rI have only a few profiles on this PC\r Let‚Äôs say that I want to create a shortcut to launch the browser to my Warner.Digital tenant. I‚Äôd use the following steps: Before we start, we need to know the location of the shortcut we want to create. The shortcut we need consists of three components: [path to your Edge executable] [profile flag] [url]. I usually open a file in Notepad to write down my shortcut path. The first part is easy: you want to find where the Edge executable is installed on your computer. It is most likely \"c:\\program files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\", but we‚Äôll confirm it in the next step. The second part of your shortcut is the profile flag. It usually consists of the following: --profile-directory=\"Your profile directory\". To find your profile directory, follow these steps: Launch Edge under the profile you wish to use. I‚Äôm going to use my Warner Digital one for this example While running as the Edge profile you want, in the address bar, type: edge://version and hit Enter In the page that appears, you should find the path to your Edge installation under Executable path, and the path to your profile, under Profile path. NOTE: You may be tempted to use the value from Command-line, but it always points to the wrong profile path ‚Äì at least in the version of Edge that I‚Äôm currently using. You only need the last part after the last \\ of your Profile path. For example, my profile path is D:\\Users\\hugoa\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Profile 4, so I‚Äôll use Profile 4 We have what we need for the first two parts of your shortcut! My shortcut to launch my Warner Digital profile would be \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\" --profile-directory=\"Profile 4\". Note that if your profile path has any spaces in it, you‚Äôll want to use double quotes (\"), like I did in mine. If you just want your shortcut to open to a blank tab (or whatever is your default start page for that profile), you don‚Äôt need to add anything else. However, if you want to launch a particular URL, just add a space, followed by whatever URL you want. For example, to launch SharePoint in the Warner Digital tenant, I‚Äôd use: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\" --profile-directory=\"Profile 4\" https://warnerdidigal.sharepoint.com Once you have your shortcut path ready, you can use whatever approach you want to create the shortcut. If you want to create shortcuts for your Elgato Streamdeck, just use the path as is (see below). To create a new Windows shortcut, use these steps: In Windows, go to the location where you want your shortcut to be created and select New \u003e Shortcut In the Create Shortcut dialog, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter the location of the new item. , just past your new shortcut path and select Next Give your new shortcut a name, for example I used Warner Digital and select Finish. That‚Äôs all you need! You should be able to add the shortcut to your Start Menu, your task bar, or anywhere on your desktop.

I should probably get myself the XL Stream Deck one of these days‚Ä¶ One thing that many people don‚Äôt know (I myself learned it from David Warner, who is the king of gadgets) is that you can create folder buttons on your Streamdeck. Your folder can contain a different set of buttons ‚Äì or even more folders! To create a folder in Stream deck: Launch your Stream Deck application In the right pane, search for folder and select Create folder from the Stream Deck group Drag the Create folder icon to a blank button on your Stream Deck. After you drop the Create folder icon on a button, it will create a new folder for you. While the new button is selected, you can edit the folder‚Äôs title or icon, if you wish. If you click on the newly created folder, it will open into the new folder where you can add new buttons or more folders. You can also click on the back arrow icon (on the top left button in the folder) to go back one level. Theoretically, you could create an infinite number of folders with buttons‚Ä¶ so the possibilities are endless. Here‚Äôs how I use my Streamdeck. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of other ways to set it up, but this is how I like to set mine up: \r At the root, I have folder for Edge profiles, one for Teams instances, and one for regular Meetings In my Edge folder, I have all my most frequently used profile. The ones I use for my clients and my personal tenants. \r In my Teams folder, I have all my frequent Teams clients that I use. \r And, finally, in my Meetings folder, I have all the join links for all my regular meetings, as well as some frequent chat buttons. \r Of course, I make sure to select fun icons so I can easily identify which button is for what meeting ‚Äì complete with a warrior horse animated GIF for the General Microsoft 365 Special Interest Group bi-weekly call, because: Chris Kent. You may wonder: why wouldn‚Äôt I just create a folder for each client/team I work with and put my Edge, Teams, and meetings buttons in each client folder? Sometimes I work with more clients than I have buttons available, and I still want to have enough room to have my ZoomIt, PowerPoint presentation, light control, and sound control buttons :-( ","date":"February 6, 2021","objectID":"https://hugoabernier.github.io/blog/launching-edge-with-different-profiles-using-shortcuts/:6:0","tags":["streamdeck","microsoftedge"],"title":"Launching Edge with different profiles using shortcuts","uri":"https://hugoabernier.github.io/blog/launching-edge-with-different-profiles-using-shortcuts/"},{"categories":["Productivity"],"content":"Conclusion I hope that this will help you making the most of shortcuts with Edge profile.
